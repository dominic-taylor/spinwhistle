### About
spinwhistle is a browser based app that lets users record multitracks of audio through the built in speaker of their device.

The aspiration for the project is anywhere someone has an idea for a melody or beat, they can easily record the sound through the app, then work on it later at a DAW etc.

### MVP Goals
* A user can record up to 3 minutes of audio, across up to 5 tracks.
* A user can export a recording to their device or save it to a database.
* After recording, a user can delete a track.
* Basic audio engineering functionality, changing volume, muting tracks etc.
